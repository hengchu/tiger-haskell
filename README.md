# tiger-haskell
Modern compiler implementation in Haskell (Tiger programming language)

This is an attempt to create a tiger programming language compiler
since I wanted to learn Haskell while doing something fun. A year
ago I took a Yale CPSC 421 class and we implemented a compiler for
the same language in SML. We had a lot of boilerplate code back
then, but this time I'd try to make everything from scratch.

I am very new to Haskell and I probably make a lot of mistakes. If you spot
anything bad, please let me know! I would greatly appreciate it!

# Current progress
Re-implementing everything from Frontend to IR translation to get rid
of `unsafePerformIO` hacks. Temporarily unbuildable.
